Good afternoon,<br><br>

Thank you so much for your interest in HackPSU! We value your expertise and enthusiasm, which is why we would love to have you involved as a judge. However, judging opportunities are exclusively available to our event sponsors.<br><br>

We offer various sponsorship tiers to fit different levels of commitment and involvement. We would be delighted to discuss these options with you and tailor a package that aligns with your company's goals and interests.<br><br>

We would love to have you participate in our upcoming spring hackathon, scheduled for March 28-29. We confidently believe that our talented students would be excited to connect with you and your company, giving you a unique opportunity to engage with and recruit top talent from Penn State. In previous years, our in-person events attracted over 400 students. We expect to see an even greater turnout this semester.<br><br>

Please let us know if you would be interested in exploring this opportunity further. We are happy to provide additional details and answer any questions you may have. Please feel free to contact us at sponsorship@hackpsu.org for any inquiries or comments. We are genuinely so excited about the potential partnership with your company to make HackPSU an extraordinary success!<br><br>

Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to hearing back from you!<br><br>

Best,<br>
The HackPSU Team
